Street Pacman - Makers Academy final project
==========================================

#### Try out the game
[Street Pacman](https://street-pacman.herokuapp.com/)


#### How to play?
Street Pacman is inspired by the '80s game Pacman but with a twist: it's now a real-life tag game. 5 players connect to the app and choose to be either Pacman or one of the 4 Ghosts. Pacman's goal is to eliminate every Ghost with the help of 4 super pellets located on the map and the Ghosts' aim is to tag Pacman.

The game ends when either Pacman gets tag when is is vulnerable or when Pacman tags all 4 Ghosts.
